#### May 11

Set aside my money for rent (which is due on the 11th at my current residence)

I don't remember if this was the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd time that I'd spent a Monday palling around with the bartender Kevin at BJ's, but he took exceedingly good care of me on the 11th. He ended up giving me 2 rounds for free. Stayed there pretty much the whole evening.

After I went home I snuggled with the cat for a bit and then passed out.

#### May 12

Got an enchilada plate from Fuzzy's, and then ate it at home while syncing anime with NoNickname. More Maomaosaga and finished off Okitsura. I was dissatisfied with how inconclusive the ending of Okitsura was, but all in all the anime was pretty fun.

After my sync with him, it was actually time for one of my last remaining shifts at Nepoburger.

The WiFi doesn't work at Nepoburger (this is actually the primary reason I quit[^1])

Seems like it was an awful shift.

Got home at around 2300 and then immediately went to bed.

#### May 13

Seems like I was experimenting a lot with gvt-g on my T480, but to no avail.

I hooked up with a 50 year old sissy, hole was so good I was walking like a cripple for an hour afterwards.

Went to Cost-ko for a slice of pizza and a frozen latte afterwards, apparently my local Cost-ko doesn't call out numbers at the food court anymore.

I don't remember what I was doing after that if not just messing around with my laptop, but apparently I was awake until the wee hours of the morning on the 14th.

#### May 14

Was tired as hell, but somehow compensated for that by gorging myself. I had like two packs of mi goreng and a veggie burger in the first half of my shift at work. Seems like I made it through just fine.

Went to bed somewhat early to compensate for the lack of sleep on the 13th.

#### May 15

Woke up feeling well-rested, but rorangagged for too long and didn't have time to go to the conbini before work. I think I was really craving a protein cookie or something.

Seems like I got zipline set up on my server while I was at work, and I tested out Elin to see how performant it was.

My boy Riker poached a new recruit for my discord server. A tremendously homosexual SEA artist.

Seems like the Discord was really popping off on the 15th. Work seemed to be good, and then I went straight to happy hour[^2] at BJs after I got off.

My last message was around 2100, so I guess I went to bed at a decent time.

#### May 16

Had a pretty chill day at work.

Let the dogs out immediately after getting home.

Went to bed sometime shortly after my landlady got home from work, she thanked me for letting the dogs out.

#### May 17

The first thing I said on the 17th was "why do cats constantly feel the need to knock shit over." I assume the feloid must've been causing mayhem in my room.

Made $120. Must've been really busy at work. Also volunteered to work a double the following day.

Went to the thrift store to buy clothes for work while waiting for Serel to wake up so we could sync. That ended up taking a bit longer than I anticipated, also stopped at Fuzzy's for a snack.

I think our session ended up being cut in half and we watched the stuff we missed at a later day.

#### May 18

The 18th was another lucrative day, I made a cheeky $50 in 2 hours. 

Somehow broke my server while I was working my double. Scheduled a KVM/IP session to unfuck it.

IDR what happened, but I complained about the feloid making me bleed somehow.

#### May 19

I had my KVM/IP appointment and quickly unfucked my server.

Ate breakfast at Fuzzy's.

Went to the optometrist for my first eye exam since before the pandemic, and ordered two pairs of glasses.

Went thrifting and found a *really* nice shirt.

Said to my mates that next month was the month that I'd accept the fact that I'm trans-adjacent and start presenting as more feminine/gay. 

After all that, I went back to BJ's to welcome my favourite bartender back. He'd been off since the last time I was there.

Seems like the 19th was a really productive day.

#### May 20

Seems like on the 20th I synced with NoNickname and then Serel.

I'm unsure why, but I ended up staying up pretty late. Didn't go to sleep until like 0200 on the 21st.
