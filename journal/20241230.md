- ### Daily Life
	- I woke up early today; I think this is my second day in row getting about 6 hours of sleep before getting blasted by the Sun.
	- Appreciated artwork for like an hour immediately after waking up and before saying anything to anyone else. 
	- After actually getting up and getting dressed I ran into my landlord who informed me that I can park in the house's driveway if I want because I'm renting the most expensive room in the house. He seems to be really keen on me lately, which is a welcome change.
	- When I returned to my room after that, I ate some pumpkin seed granola and watched the first episode of Beheneko with Serel.
	- After that I found myself listening to Brandon Sanderson lectures (as well as other writing advice and such) while doing my mobile game dailies.
	- Now I'm at a point where I have about six hours of useful consciousness left and I want to do my daily Japanese study and get some writing done. If not creating new prose, I want to at least document some of my characters and plot threads.
	- I'm a little stressed/disheartened because I saw a powertripping Discord mod come down hard on someone just because they were curious about something. I hate to see people stifle the curiosity of others, especially about something as innocuous as community history.
