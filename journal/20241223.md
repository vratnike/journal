### Life

It's the day before Xmas Eve. I'm at work right now (0028) and I have a job interview at 0930, then I need to sleep and awake so I can watch anime with Serel. Then tomorrow I have Xmas with my oathie's family. I imagine I'll probably be recuperating all day Wednesday. 

Work has been extremely slow, at least. Slow enough that I could work on this and do my Anki reps.


### Meta

Been thinking about how to better organize my thoughts using hierarchial tags and rhizomatic (in medias res perhaps, or "naturally arising") thought rather than arborescent (contrived, or monodirectional) thought.

Gonna start just dumping things I remember reading/playing/watching/being-exposed-to into their respective category pages and then I'll collect my thoughts on them later as they arise. 

### Writing

I really want to work on some of the relationship scenes between the protags of my first novel. Need to tap into the gay zone.
