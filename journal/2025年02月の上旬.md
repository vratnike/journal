#### Beginning of February

##### Overview

Well, January was pretty rough but it ended on an optimisic note. Unfortunately I didn't carry that optimism with me into February.

I had intended to start a workout routine, save money, keep records of everything I eat, and make better use of my time. For the first ten days I definitely haven't done that.

Eh, I made rent and I haven't gone hungry at all these 10 days, so I suppose it's not all bad. I still have 3 paycheques remaining this month and they should all be straight savings and food.

Aside, but ever since [天天天国地獄国](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTplxWaAD8o) premiered on the 4th I've been listening to that all 旬. Shit is catchy as fuck.

##### February 1st

Saturdays are usually chill at work, but on the 1st our boss worked us ragged. For bfast I had a Celsius and the last of my pumpkin seed granola + soy milk. For lunch I had some ancient grain granola + soymilk. I kept snacking on granola althroughout my shift tbh. Got home and fapped instead of doing anything productive. Didn't end up writing this journal entry until I went to bed the morning of the 2nd (writing on my phone.)

##### February 2nd

IDR what happened on the 2nd tbh. I do remember getting blindsided by my Cost-ko membership automatically renewing though.

##### February 3rd

The morning of February 3rd after I got off work I was gonna go pick up some Amazon packages I'd accidentally ordered to a locker in Mansfield where I used to live, but around 75% of the way there, I realised I could just let them be returned for a refund so that I could make rent, lol.

After sleeping and waking up I went to go hang out with my friend Harry McNabb, leader of the Morbid Corvids. We spoke for a while and he went to bed relatively early, I just entertained myself and killed time, then went to bed early.

##### February 4th

I think this was the 2nd or 3rd week of my routine of going to Fuzzy's on Tuesdays to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday deal. Woke up early, packed up, but before I could get the chance to leave I ended up talking to my mate and keeping his company for a while because he'd been going through it lately.

After that I left about 1h30m late, but Serel had been dragged away for lunch himself, which gave me time to eat tacos after all. Went to Fuzzy's, gorged myself, then went home and enjoyed my regular Tuesday activities with Serel.

Tuesdays are always good days. 

Looks like this was also the day that I got the [jp-mining-note](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note-prerelease/) completely set up and started sentence mining in earnest. I stopped messing around with my JLPT study deck because I wasn't retaining vocab learned in isolation nearly as well as the stuff I encountered while immersing. Should still be able to hit my vocab target mining on my own.

##### February 5th

Before I had gone to bed, I ended up slipping out of my place to go get a soda refill and then somehow got locked out when I got back home. That was an extremely frustrating experience. Somehow the lady of the house was still awake and noticed that I was locked out so she let me in, that was a major relief. I enjoyed the rest of my morning after that until it was time to go to bed.

The aforementioned Harry McNabb who I had visited and kept the company of was being featured as the featured author at Mad Swirl this month. Me and my brother were going to go watch his set together, but my brother became suddenly ill and cancelled on me. 

I think the combo of getting locked out and cancelled on in the span of 24 hours just mentally KO'd me, I spent like 2-3 hours just laying in bed because I couldn't gather the wherewithal to go shave and get dressed.

When I did eventually get my shit together, I went to Bishop Arts by myself and had a really good meal and a beer. Turns out that eating food makes you less miserable; who'd've thought?

Paid my tab and made my way to Barbara's Pavillion to see my mate read and made there with plenty of time to spare. Hung out with him for a while, listened to his set and then dipped to continue hanging out with myself. After I left the venue I made my way to one of my old haunts only to find that the power outlets where I normally sat were fucked, and consequently I couldn't use my laptop. Incidentally, the drip coffee there was exceptionally foetid for some reason. I drank two cups that night anyways, and then excused myself.

After getting home, I realised that the internet was experiencing an outage. I guess that's the 3rd bad thing to have happened in a row, if the shitty coffee counts maybe the 3.5th thing to happen. 

I rearranged the furniture in my room a bit so that my Steam Deck had somewhere to sit. I'm using that + an external monitor + mouse and keyboard as a bootleg workstation setup.

##### February 6th

I went to sleep at a decent hour that morning. Slept in for an hour. 

Thursdays are Mondays for me, so they're generally unpleasant. Work was minimally acceptable though, but I was struggling with getting Fennec+Rikaitan+Jitendex to play nice on my phone. idk if it was a memory leak or what, but it basically made it impossible to do anything else while waiting on the dictionary to import, and so I ended up being really quiet until the morning of the 7th.

One thing to note that I didn't realise at the time, is that the colleague who I usually let borrow my power bank didn't return it directly to me that night.

##### February 7th

I went to sleep somewhat late on the morning of the 7th (I had stayed up to copy games and stuff from my laptop to my Deck), only to be woken up a few hours into my sleep cycle. The man of the house was investigating the internet outage (which had continued since the 5th). He scheduled an appointment with a cable guy and as he works 2nd shift, he wouldn't be at home to let the guy in, but I would.

Couldn't get back to sleep, so I called in at work and stayed up until the cable guy arrived. He got here an hour earlier than expected and identified the problem with our internet; someone had run over the cable box. With their car. There were treadmarks on the fucking box. He returned the box to its rightful position and I guess reseated the cables or something, and our service was immediately restored. 

Since I was awake anyways, I hit my brother up and asked him if he wanted to join me for lunch/dinner. He got sent home from work because he was still sick, so we ended up going to BJs for a few pints. Was a good meal and a nice hangout; definitely made up for the 5th.

I did the bigdick wannabe Oriental thing and grabbed the check. I had already set aside the money for rent this month so I was feeling confident. 

I was exhausted so I only stayed up till about 28h, but for the last few hours of my useful consciousness I was actually playing Ikusa Megami Zero and taking notes for my LP

##### February 8th

Woke up really early on the 8th. Went out for a meal (Fuzzy's again, lol) and then returned home to mess around on my computer until it was time to leave for work.

Got to work and inquired about my power bank only to realise that my life had been culturally enriched. I guess that's $60 down the drain.

Additionally, it was unreasonably fucking cold on the 8th. I had to borrow a hoodie from a smoker it was so cold. And even that was barely sufficient to protect me from the cold.

Besides getting fucked out of my power bank and freezing my arse off, I was also really lonesome because none of my boys were around, so I ended up just chatting in the `#elona` channel for a while. Got home and went to bed pretty early.

##### February 9th

I woke somewhat bitter/depressed, not sure about what in particular-- probably just aimless dread about having to go to work and anticipation of the weekend. After I pulled myself out of bed I went to Fuzzy's again for a burrito, then I went to work immediately afterwards.

During my breakfast though, I found myself involved in a really stupid altercation about nothing. I stepped on a peer's toes because I was lamenting the fact that I don't know anyone else who actually engages in sentence mining, and I guess it sounded like I was endorsing some reddit or /djt/ type shit rather than a healthy diet of immersion. Frankly, I'm still worried about having lost face because of this even though all I did was try to converse with a different peer about studying. 

I guess work was alright. Didn't end soon enough though.

One exciting thing happened after I got home. The lady of the house actually gave me a key to the front door. Now it feels like I actually live here, and hopefully shouldn't have to worry about getting locked out again.

After getting inside I went straight to bed.

##### February 10th

Today was the start of my weekend so I was pretty excited, but once again found myself holding on to my bed for dear life. I really did not want to get up. Was due to go visit my friend Harry again, so I bribed myself to get up by:

- Deciding to come back home after the visit rather than spending the night
- Get Salad and Go along the way

So I got my wrap from Salad and Go and devoured that shit, and weathered the rainy Texas roads to my mate's house, only to find that he was completely lethargic. He went to bed immediately after I arrived and I didn't remain much longer. All I got out of that visit was a piece of cheesecake as a consolation prize.

After getting home from that I've just been aimlessly browsing the web and trawling through chat logs to piece together this journal entry. 

Have listened to some good music though:
- Hohenbaden - Markgraf (singer really reminds me of the guy from Cirith Ungol)
- Viento 1. - Camila Bañados
-  I think that's it so far actually.

And now I'm gonna actually update my website, and hopefully find the strength to work on my LP for a few hours before bed. I do want to go to bed early though, so I can take advantage of Taco Tuesday on the 11th.
