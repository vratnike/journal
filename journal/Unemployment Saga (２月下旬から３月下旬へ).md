### Overview

Despite having an overabundance of time I accomplished a single thing. Haven't found employment in a month. Trap-kun disappeared. I helped a mate named Narius install NixOS and start getting acclimated to Linux.

The existential dread of being unable to find a job combined with being a burden to everyone around me pretty much rendered me impotent to focus on anything unsupervised. Fell really behind in my studies and haven't been keeping up with my journal, so I'm going to try to catch up all at once now that I've regained some semblance of lucidity.

##### February 21

The 21st was a pretty chill day. I felt much better than I did on the 20th, and I just dogsat for my brother. I also updated my blog to have "support me" buttons/links. Re-read my favourite CG set by Nagi Ichi. 

Redaction: Immediately received donations from a few mates, idk if they want to be named or not so I'm erring on the side of cautious and leaving them anonymous.

Went to the gym
##### February 22nd

The 22nd was pretty chill as well. I dogsat for my brother again, and also went to the gym again.

I got some character traits for a character in a story I'm working on from a mate named Dart.

##### February 23rd

I don't think I left the house on the 23rd, but I ended up really nostalgic and diving into parts of ancient weeb culture such as Ukagaka and Galaxy Angel.

Listened to a lot of songs and watched a lot of gameplay footage of stuff from the early 00's. It's kind of sickening how old I've become.

##### February 24th

I don't remember doing much of anything on Monday aside from watching some anime with NoNickname. Have been working my way through Maou 2099 and AiPri. 

I was really excited because I managed to get an interview lined up at a Starbucks. So excited that I actually went and bought a dress shirt just for the interview. Unfortunately that excitement ended up being for nothing.

##### February 25th

The 25th was a Tuesday, so naturally it was a good day thanks to my boy Serel.

Aside from my usual shenanigans with him, I somehow ended up grinding out Esser in GBF on a whim while in bed.

##### February 26th

The Wednesday of the 26th I attended RVC with my brother and wasn't particularly dignified while there. I think I had fun though. There was a really cute newface there.

What I read was [[春行 (Haruyuki)]] and [[水銀灯]]

The main gap in my memory for that day is that I can't remember what we did for food. Ever since Campo Verde closed down we've had to go elsewhere.

##### February 27th

I didn't do anything on the 27th aside from read on Japanese phrases and banter with people.

##### February 28th

Went to my local clique's writing group (Morbid Corvids) for the first time in what feels like a year or two. The cute newface from RVC ended up coming around and I got pretty upset that I didn't have the chance to talk to him. He's actually a proper nerd who reads high-fantasy and seems to be somewhat savvy about the stuff I care about, making him an anomaly and worth my attention.

The rest of the writers in DFW don't give a shit about spec fic, and don't care about fantasy aesthetics. Seriously, the lack of anybody to talk shop with really makes me want to just give up. I'm not interested in solipsism, I'm interested in communicating with others.

That being said, the meeting was chaotic and I didn't get an opportunity to talk much to the new guy, so I fucked off early.

#### Summary

The end of February sucked, but I'm hoping that I get to know the literary newcomer better.

### 2025年03月の上旬

#### March 1st

On the first the main thing that happened was that I started looking into non-Tor darkweb solutions, starting with i2p. I was pretty disappointed with how shallow i2p seemed.

Experienced REALLY bad chest pain (specifically, a sharp pain in my left rib) the night of the 1st and couldn't sleep because of it. I never figured out what the root cause was, but I figured out that it only occurred when I put pressure on my back. Changing position eliminated the pain, so I don't think it was cardiac in nature. Ultimately what I had to do was ignore the pain and massage my rib cage until it went away. I don't know how or why that solved it, but it did.

#### March 2nd

Hung out with Harry, the leader of the Morbid Corvids for a while. He caught me off-guard by saying that I shouldn't be resentful of other people for seeming disinterested in my work when I don't have anything to read. 

I'm not really interested in making excuses for my lack of output, but I will say that having nobody in the local scene to talk shop with definitely hurts. Even my brother is like "yeah, totally I'll listen" and then feigning interest becomes too tiresome after a few minutes. 

#### March 3rd

Ended up pawning my Steam Deck because I had $-50 cash on hand. Also received donations from 2 mates (but they wouldn't hit my account till Sunday, so I was still fucked).

Aside from that the day was uneventful.

#### March 4th

Another Tuesday. Ended up syncing with NoNickname before Serel, so I consumed a shitload of anime on this day.

Thanks to pawning my Deck I was able to have my usual Tuesday meal of veggie tacos.

#### March 5th

Another Wednesday. Hung out with my brother, got grilled for missing out on one opportunity to apply for an IT job which completely ruined my mood. After that we went to Jaquval to eat/drink/write.

Pretty decent day.

#### March 6th

I don't remember much about this Thursday other than sleeping really poorly. Also learning of Kikuo whose music is really good.

#### March 7th

So I shortchanged myself on sleep in anticipation of getting to a temp agency early.

I made it to said temp agency, having already filled out all the paperwork like a week ago. Got there, had an interview with a recruiter, and she signed me up for a job. Now see, I did the drug test, filled out direct deposit, and she told me that I had been signed up for a job, right? I didn't realise at the time, but this was complete bullshit. What she actually did was put me on a waiting list for openings for this position. Because I didn't understand that that was the situation, this put me in a false sense of security which informed my subsequent decisions in a really shitty way.

#### March 8th

Was really tired/sleepless on the 8th. Also got into a stupid altercation with an old friend because he decided to retroactively take umbrage about a running joke. Going so far as to break his word to me and go digging in logs from before our statute of limitations.

Shit rolls downhill, so I got pissy with Rykerr whose hobby it is to gainsay everyone in chat about everything, basically just regurgitating the same shit I got from my old friend 10 years ago when I was still green myself. Going through that shit back in the day improved my rhetoric significantly, so I hope passing down the lectures has the same effect on others.

That night I failed to take a shower because I didn't think there was hot water at home, I would later learn that someone just adjusted the spout and the indicators for hot vs cold are backwards.

#### March 9th

DST hit.

My brother was the featured reader at Second Sunday Spoken Word, which is all the way in Fort Worth. So I ended up driving his mom there, and meeting him there immediately after he got off work. 

The event was pretty fun, I read my two latest poems again. Gratis popcorn. Brother spotted me for beer and then dinner at Chili's.

Aside from the event I don't think I did anything else before passing out.

#### March 10th

On the 10th I started marathoning all of Rimukoro-sensei's manga on a whim. Finished his one-shot about the gangster, and caught up with serialisation of 君のラブを見つけてくれ.

I was still in the false sense of security from the temp agency which supposedly signed me up for a job, so I ended up having a meal at BJ's by myself while reading manga.

That's all I did on the 10th.

#### Summary

Although a few fun things happened during this third of the month, I wasn't really able to enjoy any of it. Filling out a billion job applications, getting jerked around by the agency, and becoming further and further indebted to the people around me just negated any positive shit that might've happened.

But yeah, during that 10 day period I was also continuing to fill out applications. Also was playing the anniversary event in GBF, didn't really feel the need to mention that.

### 2025年03月の中旬

#### March 11th

Did fuckall, and this was the day I learned that the temp agency I mentioned on the 7th had actually set me up for failure.

Well, I also started migrating all of my dotfiles and other linux config to home-manager + a nix flake. I think that counts as fuckall to most people though.

#### March 12th 

Spent the day spamming the fuck out of applications and looking into more local temp agencies.

#### March 13th

Couldn't sleep the night of 12th, so I pulled an all-nighter and visited all of the nearby temp agencies in order of nearest to furthest. They all unilaterally told me to fuck off because either they didn't have anything to offer, or because I wasn't forklift certified/experienced.

Passed out after that

#### March 14th

Rearranged the crates in my room to create something of a bootleg standing desk.

Synced with NoNickname.

Went to Morbid Corvids for the 2nd time since I started attending again. My mental was much better this time around and I was the last one to leave. Had a pretty good time.

#### March 15th

Watched some Inuyasha with Serel, it'd been on our backlog since forever.

My auntie apprised me of the fact that she has an old friend who's the GM of a Burger King. Said friend might be willing to put her hand in the fire for me so that I can hired there.

#### March 16th

Received and filled out the application for the aforementioned Burger King. Was told to go to bed early and try visiting the BK the following day, but I ended up being too restless to sleep at all and just laid in bed for 7 hours waiting for Godot. This all ended up being in vain regardless, as my contact was off on Monday.

#### March 17th

Woke up late, sponged a meal off of my brother+auntie. After being shooed out of there I went to the gym and did 3 miles of rucking on the treadmill, my backpack was exceptionally heavy because it had lots of misc. junk in there, so that actually wore me the fuck out.

Passed out as soon as I got home

#### March 18th

Woke up about 5 hours after passing out on the 17th. Got up, made myself presentable and then drove to the BK to talk to my contact for real. I got there too early, she couldn't hear me through the drive-thru, and I had to wait for the dining room to open at 0700. Finally did speak to her, and she basically told me that she had to speak to someone about me at 1030, and that she'd update me and my auntie later. Well, as of writing this post it's 1212 and I haven't been updated yet, so... idk what to think, but I'm holding on to hope.
