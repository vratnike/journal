### Acknowledgements and Gratitude 

I'd like to offer my gratitude to everyone who helped me make it through this Spring.

Thank you to: 
- My beloved brother and best friend (domestic) Brian Duran-Fuentes and his mother Aida for taking care of me when nobody else would.
	- Please purchase my brother's [books](https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=dur%E1n-fuentes%20brian&cm_sp=det-_-plp-_-author)
- My best friend (foreign) Serel for always keeping my company, no matter where I've been or what I've been going through, he's been one of the few constants in my life and I love him dearly.
- My friend NoNickname to whom I'm greatly indebted, if it weren't for his support in 2024 and then in this Spring, I would be carless, jobless, and dead.
- The elusive Dartier who bailed me out more than once. I consider him a friend, personally, although I know not what he thinks of me.
- Rykerr and Trapezehedron, two SEAdogs and the two people who convinced me to open my heart to others again after all of the bridgeburning I did last year.

Each and every one of you is responsible for my continued existence, and I sincerely hope to repay you in some manner for your support. 
### Brief overview of February through April

- Helped a mate from the Elona community named Narius install Linux and start getting acclimated to the ecosystem. He's a Midwestern Trucker who had little to no command of Linux whatsoever and I managed to guide him to getting PCI Passthrough working. Makes me feel like my best friend who's a CS graduate has no fucking excuse for continuing to run Windows on baremetal.
- 2/21: I added donation buttons to my blag and asked for help on Discord, immediately got some patronage from my mates. I don't deserve y'all.
- 3/27: I got hired by a family friend at a particular franchise of a burger joint and was miserable as fuck because of feeling alienated/estranged from colleagues and the WiFi never working properly, also being discriminated against for being non-Latino. 
- I kept at it until the beginning of May, but on the 5/2 I got hired at the Nepodiner's next door by pure chance, and I resigned from nepotism burger some weeks later.

### Beginning of May

#### May 1st

I stayed late at Nepotism burger because my relief was late. Was kinda quiet on that day, probably because NepoBurger doesn't have functioning WiFi

#### May 2nd

Had a nightmare about a fight with my best friend from childhood (Steve Shen) which led to us drifting apart. I wonder if it was actually a nightmare or if it was a repressed memory. I really miss him.

Woke up early to go to the conbini and then Nepodiner's to talk to the GM there about getting hired. I got hired on the spot, feels good, man.

Work was whatever. I ended up successfully filling up my gas tank, getting an oil change, and making a payment on my ticket. Feels good, man.

#### May 3rd

I was almost late to work because the cat at my place demanded extra petting.

One of my colleagues at Nepoburger gave me an extra oreo shake which I was uncharacteristically excited for, and it immediately got knocked over and I had to mop it up. I wanted to cry.

Somehow I got talked into covering the cute twink at Nepoburger and didn't get home till like 0100 on the 4th.

#### May 4th

I worked a morning shift after closing the day prior, ended up collapsing into my bed around 1700 after getting home.

#### May 5th

Woke up early as fuck, struggled with the temperature knob in the shower at my place, went to work (Nepodiner) on time. 

Ended up working 12 hours because my relief was late (bear in mind that I just got hired on the 2nd and this is already my experience here)

Resolved to quit at Nepoburger in the near future

#### May 6th

I think I slept well and woke up feeling somewhat well-rested.

After getting to work I learned that the overnight shift got robbed.

Had the best veggie burger of my life, the cook (Ray) really outdid himself.

Found this meme, which I really like:

#### May 7th

I ended up paying the City of Mesquite the rest of the $100 I owed them for my monthly payments on my ticket (for not having insurance), which I think is still cheaper than not having insurance.

I heard Riker had an acquaintance die, and Foxfucker got a promotion at work.

Had brunch at Fuzzy's and then synced anime with NoNickname. This week we were watching Okitsura and Kusuriya.

Immediately after that it was time to sync with Serel. For sure we watched Yandere Dark Elf, Precure, and Chobits.

Beyond that I don't remember much else about the 7th.

#### May 8th

I had brunch at Jaquval with my brother, then we watched some Dragon Ball Daima at his place, and then I went home and went to bed.

#### May 9th

I went to work, fucked around on my laptop at work (played around with Suwayomi and updated stuff), then I went to Fuzzy's and gorged myself, then I went home and went to bed.

#### May 10th

Went to work. Gorged myself on pancakes and omelette, had a decent day. Seems like I stayed up a little bit browsing the internet after I got home, then I passed out.
