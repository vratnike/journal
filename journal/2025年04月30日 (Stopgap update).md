Shit has been really bad/hectic lately. 

tl;dr synopsis:

- I lost my job in February, and then one of my newest mates disappeared
- I was fucking useless from then until I got hired (thanks to a family friend of my auntie[^1]
- Although I got hired in late March, I was so far behind on money that I had to sell plasma and borrow from people just to make rent and have enough petrol in my car to make it to/from work in the first place (my commute is hellish)

Due to all those things and more I've been really negligent in both my studies and updating my journal. I'm hoping to find the time to go back and do a retroactive/retrospective post for the 旬 I missed, but if I don't[^2], then business will continue as usual with 2025年05月上旬.

[^2]: Regardless, I'm going to talk about the disappearance of my mate, and all of the people whose help I depended on in order to make it through this shit
