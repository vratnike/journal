#### End of January

- The 21st was a Tuesday, and that means I did my usual Serel activities. I believe it was around then he started working on his essay about immense design flaws present within the Warrior class in PoE2.
- On the 22nd I went to a local pub with my brother, had about 3 pints, some pretzels, and a veggie burger. Went back to his place to watch YouTube videos and chill until he went to bed. On my way back home I got stopped by a police officer in Mesquite for a field sobriety test. He gave me a break for not having insurance, not having changed my address, etc. so I thought it was in my best interests to cooperate. He called his partner, I gave them my knife, and we did the test. I passed, unsurprisingly. The whole ordeal was a little scary, but the cops in question were pretty chill. Frankly, I really like the city of Mesquite; the people from there have generally been trustworthy in my experience.
	- The reason I got pulled over in the first place is because I took a long time to go after a stoplight turned green. I was farming meat in GW, lol.
- The morning of the 23rd I started watching Kamen Rider Gaim with Serel and Ref. First 4 episodes or so were pretty interesting. After that I slept, and then my workweek begun.
- From the 23rd-26th I can't remember much of anything aside from malding at how bad popular music on the radio is. I slept extremely poorly on the 27th because of having top 40 shit stuck in my head.
- On the 27th I visited my buddy Harry McNabb, the leader of the Morbid Corvids. We hung out, talked a bunch. I did my laundry over there and spent the night.
- The 28th I woke up over there, then drove back to Mesquite and got some veggie tacos from Fuzzy's. I think I'm gonna make that a regular thing because the Taco Tuesday promo is pretty nice. After that, I went home, synced with Serel, put my laundry up, did my anki reps, and started writing this entry.
- It's the 29th now, and I'm planning on attending an open mic called RVC (Rising Voices Collective) with my brother. Usually when we go to this one, we stop at a restaurant along the way called Campo Verde; a Tex-Mex joint with a year-round Christmas theme. Big beers and they have vegetarian offerings, so I like it. Looking forward to that. Will update this post with info on the open mic and meal goes. (I still haven't written anything to read there.)
	- Update: Campo Verde may no longer exist. When me and my brother arrived there, we say that the landlord who owned the building had changed the locks and posted a lockout notice. Google Maps said they were still open, but it seems that they didn't make rent... We had to find somewhere else to eat, so we went to a local Japanese place not far from the open mic. The food was good, cheap and plentiful, but unfortunately there was no beer. Afterwards we went to a local pub for one pint, and then showed up to the open mic about 30 minutes late. 
	- The open mic itself was pretty comfy, and I ended up winning the raffle and got free admission for 2 next month; so I guess me and my brother are getting in for free. As for what I read, I read the beginning of my [["have the courage to punch down" essay]], a challenge directed towards the worst of the literary scene in DFW
	- After the open mic, we got nostalgic and wanted to see how one of our haunts from our high-school/college days was doing, so we drove all the way to Richardson to check on this old parking lot tacqueria; unfortunately they happened to have closed early, so we got cucked out of a meal for the 2nd time in one evening. After that we checked out at a 24/7 tacqueria in Mesquite p close to our respective places. We definitely overate.
	- After gorging myself with my brother and getting back to his place, we parted ways immediately so he could go to bed and so I could get back home to watch Kamen Rider with Serel and Ref. That went pretty well, and then I started binge reading Debby the Corsifa wa Makezugirai because a buddy used a panel from it as a reaction image and it looked cute. Pretty enjoyable. Finally ended up going to bed around 0815.
- On the 30th I ended up sleeping in until 2100-2110, after laying down a little after 0815... Didn't get to work until around 2230, but it was a really comfy shift. Mostly just played GBF and chatted with mates on Discord/Matrix. All I had for bfast was a muffin, lunch was a pack of instant ramen, at some point during my shift I also got given a fruit rollup, and got a pack of Belvita biscuits. I was still starving by the time I got off, went to a local diner and got a veggie omelette. After getting back to the house I'm renting at, the dogs were begging me to let them out, so I asked the lady of the house for permission to do so, and then I played with them outside for like 10-15 minutes. After that I retired to my room and started writing this post. Now I'm probably about to hygiene and go to bed, hopefully no later than 1000. Because I slept in so late, I'm going to try and wake up early tomorrow. Maybe sleep from 1000-1600 or something, 1700 at the latest.
- I ended up not sleeping much at all on the 31st and went to work tired as fuck. I was really conflicted. I had let a fuckbuddy pressure me all month into committing to meet with them on Saturday, but in reality working a 10 hour shift (while sleep deprived) and driving to bumfuck nowhere Texas to meet with a stranger who had been pestering me was just too much. My breakfast and lunch that day consisted on protein cookies iirc. Also had a Celsius. Work itself was pretty chill all things considered. Managed to hang out with the dogs a little bit and then shower after getting home on the 1st, and slept really well.
#### Retrospective on January

I missed three days of anki reps. 
- The 1st, because I was piss drunk with my brother
- The 5th, I don't remember why, but I remember being cold and sick
- The 22nd, I think I went to bed early after the ordeal with getting pulled over.

I want to ensure that this doesn't happen again in February

I missed a lot of days of work because of a combo of the cold and being sick. As a consequence I was broke as fuck throughout the whole month. This is again, something that I need to not do again in February.

My diet has been pretty inconsistent and I think I only went to the gym like 5 times max in January. I want to make it a habit to start going to the gym either before/after work on a daily basis. Can do my reps on the dreadmill or something. Also going to start recording notes on what I ate and what exercises I did on a given day in my journal.

I also intend to record how much money I save/waste each journal period. The way things shake out is each 旬 of the month has one paycheque except for one of them which has two. 

Gonna be starting an LP of 戦女神ZERO in February. Look forward to it.
