```
Where Heaven met Earth the land was sundered and cracked;
so too was your body as biscuit turned to flesh.
You are the first-born of His single-minded quest
a forlorn product from before he honed his craft.

The knowledge of this, a pain deep within your breast;
forever viewed as one shoddily manufact
unable to escape the feeling of a lack
your facade demands that you are always the best

Mercurial daughter your smile like a lamp
the palescent glow of broken stars and sick moon
your voice the sweet timbre of a harp out of tune
it's a cruel father that allow your cheek be damp

Vital silver pinion quivering in sorrow
bereft of the only one you thought had loved you
recalcitrant you shunned your sisters and their crew
Yet you've found a friend, hear her song in the morrow
