The consumptive moon compels me to act
I shall never be an ungrateful son
Her feverish gaze lights the path I walk
The great obscure pillow of the night sky
cushions Luna's body as she yet wastes
A love chimerical, silent longing
intimately sunders her flesh from bone
to delicate beams of white that bless us
The consumptive moon compels me to act

米国に
皆笑えない
夢にまで
