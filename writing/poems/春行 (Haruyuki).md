```
To me you are the Spring ephemeral
The streams surging as the snow melts away
flowers budding on branches once thought dead
So too my heart, until you held me then.

As the Spring gave way to Summer, I wept.
the sweltering heat sapped my will to live
yet no matter how I longed for the cold
I could not help but long for your touch more

In the autumn, the leaves began to change
yet my feeling remained ever constant
neither the squash nor the sweet potato
served to assuage the pains of missing you

that pain amplified yet by the Winter
short days, long nights, and no respite in sight
even had I the grit to weather this
I know beneathe the snow there is no one 
waiting for me.
