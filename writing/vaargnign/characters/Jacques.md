Jacques has a lean musclulature and is relatively tall for someone born to the Orthodoxy at around 180cm. He's always been on lighter side and never particularly fat. His eyes are black, and he has long black wavy hair. His skin was fair during his youth, but as he grow older his complexion darkened into a light olive.

#### Early Life and Adolescence

Jacques is a human born to the Orthodox Tribes in a commune hidden somewhere in the wilderness of [[Tajsha]] about 200 years after the [[Sword Saint's War]]. 
Althroughout his adolescence he felt extremely out of place among his peers in the commune, and he was constantly looking for a way out. 




[^1]: Exceptional members of the Trailblazer's Guild are afforded the privilege of taking Praeses as their cognomen.

[^2]: Him and his best friend (and later partner) [[Jean]] (Iohannes) were named at the same time. I think the concept for both characters came to me as I was reading the [[confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], so I had the bright idea of naming them like that.
