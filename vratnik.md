### About me

I am an amateur spec-fic author and an open mic regular. My primary work consists of short stories and novels in an open setting called [[writing/vaargnign/index|Vaargnign]]

If you’re interested in learning more about me or following my career you're in the right place, as my [[journal/index|Journal]] is hosted here.

> [!info]- My interests
>The things that I’m interested in or passionate about include:
>
>- [[Anime (Serel)]]/[[Manga]]/light novels. I’ve been watching an obscene amount of anime with my bestie lately.
>- Fluffy critters. I don’t consume the flesh of mammals, and I can’t contain myself around cute creatures.
>- Technology, the right to repair, and (F)OSS.
>- Music (especially jazz) and music theory
>- Certain types of video games (ARPGs, Roguelikes (according to the Berlin interpretation), and more sophisticated skinner boxes such as Elona, Minecraft, Terraria, etc.)

> [!tip]- Support Me
> Life has been really tough lately. If you want to help me survive so I can focus on my creative output, please feel free to do so through one of these avenues.
