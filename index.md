Hail!

Welcome to petrichor.moe

This is the personal website and digital garden of Jean Galante, also known as [[vratnik]]

I plan to share all of my personal notes[^1] as well as my thoughts on whatever media I consume here for the perusal of anyone who may find them useful

You can also find my journal [[journal/index|here]]

Right now I'm organising my posts like this:

- [[atoms/index|Atoms]] - Smallest unit of notes, any one-off thought or single instance of something is probably being filed as an atom
- Lists - A logical grouping of atoms, some thoughts about a number of other things that fit into the same category (I haven't made any lists yet)
- Macros - Any observations about patterns in my thinking, things that inform my worldview. (I haven't made any macros yet)
- [[writing/index|Writing]] - Any original writing, this includes essays, short stories, worldbuilding notes, poetry, etc.
- [[journal/index|Journal]] - My journal, obviously.

I host some [[services]] for personal use and for my friends.

I am open to hosting services for and giving subdomains out to interested parties.
