I like this illustration a lot tbh

><&Decanter> fox content (for serel especially because of one bit) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qkDIQZ9ySs

I wasn't highlighted for this, but "fox" highlights me regardless. I liked it in order to watch it later.

><&Decanter> serel, GallantChef: I'm learning to use CraftTweaker/ModTweaker and I'm gonna be a menace with it :v

Based. Let me know what you end up doing with it, I've been pretty nostalgic about Minecraft lately.
